This project implements the "Sofa Move Problem" — a transportation scheduling challenge faced by a company 
to ensure employees reach the office on time while buses operate under limited seating capacity due to 
pandemic restrictions.

The input is an M × M matrix representing distances between different employee locations. The objective is 
to design an efficient routing and allocation strategy that minimizes total travel time while respecting 
capacity constraints.

Key Features:
- Matrix-based distance input
- Capacity-aware bus allocation
- Optimization of routes to reduce delays
- Extendable for real-world transportation scheduling
